# Climbing Training App

Welcome to Gabes Climbing Website! This is a Flask app hosted on an AWS EC2 instance that brings together a stopwatch and hangboard workouts, Designed for climbers to enhance their training sessions as well as climbing grade conversion feature. Hangboarding is a vital component of climbing training, focusing on building finger strength and endurance. The app offers workouts categorized by difficulty levelsâ€”easy, medium, and hard as well as a stopwatch so you can time yourself. Yosemite Decimal System (YDS) and the French grading system, are two different grading systems to rate the difficulty of climbs and this app helps you convert one to the other.
